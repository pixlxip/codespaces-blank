so...
server->client communication
i can recursivel talk with await... but that might be slow
ill try it though:
the person makes a request and the server responds with stuff
then, the person sets a username and send to server.
server reponds with a success code.
client replys again with success.
server responds when there are two players and randomly picks somebody to start.
each player resieves a colour
if they are white, they can choose a piece to move
that is sent to the server
server checks if move is valid
if it isn't, error code and it awaits the person again
if it is valid, success code is sent to both players.
next player goes and sends request
afeter a turn, checkmate is checked
if it is chekmate, game ends
if it is stalemate, game ends
